                <h3>MERN stack developer, programmer and learner</h3>
                <p>I am Habib, a student, who has just completed his intermediate studies and looking forward to make a
                    profession
                    on his passion which is programming. I have started learning programming when I was in intermediate
                    first
                    year
                    and then continued besides my study but it was quite difficult to continue both at the same time
                    that's
                    why
                    I
                    had to take break almost one year gap on my coding but still I think I'm skilled enough to solve
                    different
                    types
                    of problem on MERN stack development which are commonly faced by a programmer. </p>
