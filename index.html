                <h3>MERN stack developer, programmer and learner</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">I am Habib, a student, who has just completed his intermediate studies
                    and looking forward to make a
                    profession
                    on his passion which is programming. I have started learning programming when I was in intermediate
                    first
                    year
                    and then continued besides my study but it was quite difficult to continue both at the same time
                    that's
                    why
                    I
                    had to take break almost one year gap on my coding but still I think I'm skilled enough to solve
                    different
                    types
                    of problem on MERN stack development which are commonly faced by a programmer. </p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I
                can even teach my grandma how to make simple
                website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. </p>
